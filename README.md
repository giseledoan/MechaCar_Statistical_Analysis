## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Look at the metrics generated by the summary() function. Each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model.

- Assuming significance level is 0.05%, the vehicle length (2.60e-12 or 0.00000000000260) and ground clearance (5.21e-08 or 0.0000000521) are much smaller than 0.05 statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words, the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg (mile-per-gallon).
### 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Look at the metrics generated by the summary() function.

- The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11 (or 0.0000000000535), which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05% --> there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis. In other words, the slope of our linear model is not zero.
### 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- Look at the metrics generated by the summary() function.

- The r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71.49% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model. This linear model is effective.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
- Look at the total_summary table for all lots
- ![alt text](https://github.com/giseledoan/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/Suspension_Coil_total_summary.png)
- The variance of all lots is ~62.29, less than the design specification. 
- However, when we look at the lot_summary table for each lot. 
- - ![alt text](https://github.com/giseledoan/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/Suspension_Coil_lot_summary.png)
- Variance of lot 3 is much more than specification. We should investigate lot 3. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- Look at the t-test all lots.

- The p-value is 0.06028, which is larger than the assumed significance level of 0.05 --> there is not sufficient evidence to rejct the null hypothesis.We would state that the mean of 3 lots combined (1498.78) and the mean of the presumed population (1500) are statistically similar.

- Look at the t-test lot 1 & lot 2:

- ![alt text](https://github.com/giseledoan/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/t-test-lot2.png)
- Lot 1 and 2 have presumed population of 1500 and 1500.2. The p-values of lot 1 (1) and lot 2 (0.6072) are larger than the assumed significant level of 0.05 --> we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and its presumed population mean.

- Look at the t-test lot 3:
-![alt text](https://github.com/giseledoan/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/t-test-lot3.png)
- The p-value of lot 3 is 0.04168 which is lower than the significant level of 0.05 --> we have to reject the null hyphothesis that the observed sample mean and its presumed population mean have no difference. We should investigate lot 3 to see why it has such difference. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Besides the above tests, we can run another test to see whether safety ratings are based on  highway fuel efficiency. We will determine if there is a statistical difference in highway fuel efficiency between vehicles of safety ratings above 2 vs. under 2 stars. In other words, we are testing our null hypothesisâ€”that 
- Null hypothesis: the overall difference is zero --> MeChaCar's safety ratings above 2 and under 2 has no difference in fuel efficiency. 
- Alternative: MeChaCar's safety ratings above 2 and under 2 has difference in fuel efficiency.
- Use a paired t-test.
