## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Look at the metrics generated by the summary() function. Each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model.

- Assuming significance level is 0.05%, the vehicle length (2.60e-12 or 0.00000000000260) and ground clearance (5.21e-08 or 0.0000000521) are much smaller than 0.05 statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words, the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg (mile-per-gallon).
### 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Look at the metrics generated by the summary() function.

- The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11 (or 0.0000000000535), which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05% --> there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis. In other words, the slope of our linear model is not zero.
### 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- Look at the metrics generated by the summary() function.

- The r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71.49% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model. This linear model is effective.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
- Look at the total_summary table for all lots
- ![alt text](https://github.com/giseledoan/bikesharing/blob/main/images/customer_types.png)
- The variance of all lots is ~62.29, less than the design specification. 
- However, when we look at the lot_summary table for each lot. 
- - ![alt text](https://github.com/giseledoan/bikesharing/blob/main/images/customer_types.png)
- Variance of lot 3 is much more than specification. We should investigate lot 3.
